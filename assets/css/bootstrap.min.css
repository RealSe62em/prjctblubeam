The file /prjctblubeam/prjctblubeam/assets/css/bootstrap.min.css is intended to be the minified version of Bootstrap's CSS framework. Since this is a standard file that is typically obtained from the Bootstrap website or CDN, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file is intentionally left blank for you to fill in with the actual minified content.
